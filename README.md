# spwn-runtime-string
SPWN code to store strings in a GD level for text input (do not use, still insanely buggy)

# NOTE
Strings can only have three of each character, as adding more would add too many groups and this project already takes up many. As a result, strings have to be small, and if you use more than three of each character, the character becomes the next character in the ASCII table.
